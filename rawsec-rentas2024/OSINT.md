Hint(s):
* The Sicariosâ€¦
* You might think the given picture, is useless. Guessy. But its not. If u are about to investigate a crime group. You have to criminal-profile every single member of the group. E.g what they do, eat, visit, etc. If u recon, Blacky AKA Nelson Hernandez is the only sicarios that has went to uniten IG. U should focus on that acc only. For real - If u went to other sicarios, u will get lost. Next step? Technical stuff. Dig the flag inside the IG, metadata is there. That is how u profile someone, dig deeper as u could on that acc.

Flag: RWSC{B1Acky_S1c4r1o}

This challenge took my team around 14 hours as the question is very vague and stuff. So, we have no clues on what we were supposed to search for. After the second hint was revealed it is supposed that we should look into the followers for UNITEN Official Instagram account and there we found the account handler under the name Blacky.

Like any other casual website user, we decided to inspect the elements, refresh the webpage and try to look into what's inside by CTRL+F with "RWSC" as the keyword:

# Task 2: Sica Cartel
Question: Unlike Medellin Cartel, the Cali Cartel rootcause of their falldown is clear. This is why knowledge is power!

Flag: RWSC{C4L1_C4RT3L_PWN3D}

There are no hints in this one because someone unexpectedly found the flag so soon before the question even revealed
The method perform is to take "RWSC" and "Cali Cartel" as a keyword is the search browser (Google, DuckDuckGO or etc) is doable and the first thing that will appear is a Reddit comment with the flag:
